# 🎁 BOGO Offer UI

This is a responsive and interactive **Buy One Get One (BOGO)** offer component built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no external frameworks or libraries.

It replicates a clean, mobile-friendly design inspired by the Figma screenshot, and highlights one of the options as “MOST POPULAR”.
